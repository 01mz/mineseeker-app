    <string name="instructions">BombSeeker is a game where you try to reveal all bombs in the field with the least number of scans. To check for a bomb in an area, tap the area. If there is a bomb in the area, it is revealed. If there is not, a scan is executed and a count will be shown indicating the number of bombs in the row and column of the selected area. The goal is to reveal all bombs with least number of scans. Good luck!</string>
